Problems
Write an HTML page that contains a table having four lines and four columns. The table's cells contain distinct random numbers from 1 to 15 (one of the cells being empty). Using JavaScript create a puzzle game that the user must solve. You will create a second version of the game, where numbers are replaced by small images, initially part of a bigger image. For slicing the original image in smaller pieces you may use picture editing software such as Photoshop or Gimp.
