3. Approximate the relative axial position of some tomography images based
on patient information (id, histogram of bone structure, histogram of air regions)
using a genetic programming algorithm. The set of functions will contain at least
operators +, -, *, sin, cos, and the terminal set will contain the input of the problem
and 10 constants from [0,1]. The training of the algorithm ends when the mean
square error is less than Îµ (given as a parameter of the problem). Test data will be
taken from here:
