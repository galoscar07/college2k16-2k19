1. Mini-language Specification

	The mini-language should be a restricted form of a known programming language, and should contain the following:
- 2 simple data types and a user-defined type
- statements:
	- assignment
	- input/output
	- conditional
	- loop
- some conditions will be imposed on the way the identifiers and constants can be formed.

2. Scanner implementation

	The scanner input will be a text file containing the source program, and will produce as output the following:
	- PIF - Program Internal Form
	- ST  - Symbol Table
In addition, the program should be able to determine the lexical errors, specifying the location, and, if possible,
the type of the error.

The scanner assignment will be differentiated based on:
	1. Identifiers:
		b. arbitrary length, no more than 250 characters
	2. Symbol Table:
		a. unique for identifiers and constants
	3. Symbol Table Organization:
		b. lexicographically binary tree

Documenting the scanner program is COMPULSORY!
