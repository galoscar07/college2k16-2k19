/*
 The employees of “Happy Holidays” need an application to manage all the offers that the agency has. Each Offer has a type (may be seaside, mountain or city break), a destination, a departure date and a price. The employees need the application to help them in the following ways:
 

 a. The application must allow adding, deleting and updating a tourism offer. An offer is uniquely identified by its destination and departure date.
 b. The application should offer the possibility to display all the tourism offers whose destinations contain a given string (if the string is empty, all destinations are considered) and they will be shown sorted ascending by their price.
 c. The application should be able to display all offers of a given type, starting from a given date.
 d. The application must provide the option to undo and redo the last change.
